# Rizoma - Agroproducer Verification Marketplace Setup Guide

## üìã Overview

Rizoma is a blockchain-powered marketplace for verified agricultural producers in Mexico. The platform enables international buyers to connect with certified agroproducers while maintaining full transparency through Solana blockchain verification and zero-knowledge principles for document privacy.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 19 with Vite
- React Router for navigation
- Solana Web3.js & Anchor Framework
- Solana Wallet Adapter
- Supabase Client for database

**Backend/Database:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth)
- Solana blockchain (Devnet for development)

**Smart Contracts:**
- Anchor Framework (Rust)
- Solana program in `programs/rizoma2/src/lib.rs`

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Database Setup

#### A. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Save your project URL and anon key

#### B. Run Database Schema
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire content from `rizoma-frontend/database-schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL script
4. Verify tables are created: `providers`, `products`, `documents`, `blockchain_verifications`, `reviews`, `transactions`, `categories`

#### C. Create Storage Bucket
1. Go to Storage in Supabase Dashboard
2. Create a new bucket called `provider-documents`
3. Set bucket to **public** access
4. Add policy for authenticated uploads:

```sql
-- Policy for uploading documents
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload documents"
ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'provider-documents');

-- Policy for reading documents
CREATE POLICY "Public can read documents"
ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'provider-documents');
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd rizoma-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Environment variables are already configured in .env
# Verify the file contains:
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://pvcfhehzgaidtorzwgxj.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key-here

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Solana Program Setup (Optional for Development)

The Solana program is already deployed for demo purposes, but if you want to deploy your own:

```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"

# Install Anchor
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --locked --force
avm install latest
avm use latest

# Build the program
anchor build

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

## üì± Application Features

### For Buyers (All Users)

1. **Marketplace Browsing** (`/marketplace`)
   - Search and filter verified providers
   - View provider profiles and ratings
   - Check blockchain verification status
   - Browse by category (Coffee, Avocado, Fruits, etc.)

### For Providers (Wallet Required)

1. **Onboarding** (`/onboarding`)
   - 4-step registration process
   - Company information collection
   - Legal document upload (KYC/KYB)
   - Blockchain verification

2. **Provider Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
   - Overview of company stats
   - Product management (CRUD operations)
   - Review management
   - Blockchain proof display

## üîê Zero-Knowledge Verification Flow

1. **Document Upload**
   - Provider uploads legal documents to Supabase Storage
   - SHA-256 hash is calculated for each document
   - Hash is stored in database

2. **Blockchain Registration**
   - All document hashes are concatenated
   - Combined hash is stored on Solana blockchain
   - Transaction signature serves as immutable proof

3. **Verification**
   - Buyers can verify document existence without seeing them
   - Blockchain proof confirms documentation completeness
   - Only hash visibility (privacy preserved)

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema

### Key Tables

**providers**
- Company information
- Wallet address (unique identifier)
- Verification status
- Reputation score
- Blockchain hash

**products**
- Product listings
- Pricing and availability
- Certifications
- Category classification

**documents**
- KYC/KYB documents
- File URLs (private storage)
- SHA-256 hashes
- Verification status
- Blockchain proof reference

**blockchain_verifications**
- Solana transaction signatures
- Data hashes
- Verification type
- Timestamps

**reviews**
- Buyer ratings
- Review text
- Blockchain verification
- Is verified flag

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create/verify `.env` file in `rizoma-frontend`:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://pvcfhehzgaidtorzwgxj.supabase.co
